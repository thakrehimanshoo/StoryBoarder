# StoryBoarder
Welcome to StoryBoarder! This is a simple web application that allows you to create and save storyboards using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How It Works
Drawing Canvas: The application provides a drawing canvas using the HTML <canvas> element. JavaScript is used to handle user interactions with the canvas, such as drawing strokes and erasing.
Drawing and Erasing: Users can switch between drawing and erasing modes. When in drawing mode, JavaScript captures mouse movements and draws strokes on the canvas using the HTML5 Canvas API. When in erasing mode, the color of the strokes is set to white to simulate erasing.
Clearing the Canvas: The "Clear" button triggers a JavaScript function that clears the entire canvas, allowing the user to start fresh.
Saving Snapshot: The "Save" button captures the current state of the canvas as an image using the HTML5 Canvas API. This image is then displayed to the user and can be downloaded as a PNG file.
How to Use
Navigation: Use the navigation menu at the top to navigate between different sections of the application (Home, Print, Contact Us).
Drawing: Use the drawing canvas to sketch your storyboard scenes. You can choose different drawing colors and adjust the brush size as needed.
Eraser: Toggle the eraser mode to erase parts of your drawing.
Clear Canvas: Click the "Clear" button to clear the entire canvas and start over.
Save Snapshot: Click the "Save" button to save your storyboard as an image. You can then download the image for future reference.
